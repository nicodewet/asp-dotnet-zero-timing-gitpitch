## Software Delivery Quicksand

- Useful metaphor
- Second definition applies

> 1. Loose wet sand that yields easily to pressure and sucks in anything resting on or falling into it.
> 2. A bad or dangerous situation from which it is hard to escape.

- ASP.NET Zero may help in some situations

## Hypothetical Scenario

- Greenfield product scenario
- Either large enterprise or startup
- Need to prove innovative product in market and make money
- Two pizza (i.e. colocated) team (speaker note: remember the signifigance of this, to mention it)
- Use open source stacks (put in or not?)

## Hypothetical Quicksand Symptoms

- Low velocity, far too long from concept to delivery
- Pivoting makes velocity worse, hard to do
- Speaker note: dangerously high staff rotation

--- 

## Some Hypothetical Causes

- [Probably many](https://svpg.com/top-10-reasons-for-slow-velocity/)
- Backlog unsized etc (NB: speaker note)
- We'll focus on subset of software engineering concerns (CI/CD & good software practices)
