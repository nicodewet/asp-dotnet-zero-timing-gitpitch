## Software Delivery Quicksand

> 1. Loose wet sand that yields easily to pressure and sucks in anything resting on or falling into it.
> 2. A bad or dangerous situation from which it is hard to escape.

---

## The Metaphor and ASP.NET Zero

- Useful metaphor
- ASP.NET Zero *may* help in some situations

---

## The Art of Manliness

- [How to Escape Quicksand: An Illustrated Guide](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-escape-quicksand-an-illustrated-guide/)
- Step 1 is knowing you are in it

## W. Edwards Deming

> Doing your best is not enough, you have to know what to do, then
> do your best

---

## Hypothetical Scenario

- Greenfield product scenario
- Either large enterprise or startup
- Need to prove innovative product in market and make money

---

## Hypothetical Scenario

- Two pizza (i.e. colocated) team
- Use open source stacks (put in or not?)
- Agile SDLC

--- 

## Quicksand Symptoms

- Low velocity, far too long from concept to delivery
- Pivoting makes velocity worse, hard to do
- Team rotation

--- 

## Quicksand Symptoms

- Team remains in storming phase
- Low trust

--- 

## Some Hypothetical Causes

- [Probably many](https://svpg.com/top-10-reasons-for-slow-velocity/)
- We'll focus on subset of software engineering concerns

---

## Engineering Team Concern: Type of Experience

- Too much established business engineering experience
- Don't write hundreds of SPA unit tests

---

## Lean Enterprise Fundamentals

- Lean Enterprise: How High Performance Organizations Innovate At Scale

> There are no awards for elegance of software design or automated test coverage
> in an MVP - the more skeletal, the better, provided we can gather the
> information we need.

---

## Lean Enterprise Caveat

- Waterfall works when copying a proven idea
- Re-use existing software to move fast

---

## Hotel Booking Example

- Most profitable code I've written.
- Adapted 2007 [JBoss Seam Hotel Booking example](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Web_Platform/5/html/Seam_Reference_Guide/booking.html).
- Never mastered entire stack.

---

## Engineering Team Concern: Adaptability

- Some engineers are good for a v1 (prototype) build
- Some engineers are good for a v2 build
- Some can adapt to both, some can't

---

## Engineering Team Concern: Rotation

- Cannot predict rotation at start

---

## Engineering Team Concern: Rotation

- Can react to rotation
- Can *control cognitive* load on team
- Can *control cognitive* load on **newcomers**

---

## Making KickAss Developers

- Going from A to C
- The effect of high quality teaching
- Spring Core

---

## Uncle Bob

- Clean, framework free code

---

## Engineering Team Concern: Rotation

- *Can* control scope
- *Can* press reset button
- *Can* move to the norming-performing stages

--- 

## Hypothetical Architecture Before Reset

---

## Architecture After Reset

---

## Key Framework SDLC Benefits

- UI *constrained* by existing patterns
- Developers can focus on service layers
